Creation of docker image:
first command:
docker build -t sample_node_test .

main step here is to create a docker public repository with same name as sample_node_test.

next step is to :
second command:
docker login

third command:
creation of tag 
According to that naming convention, the unofficial image name should be 
named as follows: <username>/<image_name>:<tag_name>. In my case, I need to rename it as gauravvv/example_image:latest
here sample_node_test is image name and latest is the tag. after tag is repo name.
docker tag sample_node_test:latest shrivatsarao26/sample_node_test:latest


fourth command:
we need to push use this command.
docker push shrivatsarao26/sample_node_test:latest

Upload your tagged image to the repository using the docker push command. 
Once complete, you can see the image there on Docker Hub. 
That's it; you have successfully published your Docker image. 
If you want to test out your image, use the below command and launch a container from it:

fifth command to test the docker-image:
pull it first.
docker pull shrivatsarao26/sample_node_test:latest


then run it:
docker run -it shrivatsarao26/sample_node_test:latest

keep image name and repo name same to same.
